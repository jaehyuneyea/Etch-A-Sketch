# Etch-A-Sketch

<p>This web application is an computer-version of an etch-a-sketch; as you hover over the tiles with your mouse, it colours itself into that tile. The reset button clears the board and gives you the option of resizing up to a grid size of 100x100! The RGB button selects a random RGB value and colours it onto the tile.</p>

<p>3/19/2022: Finished the main application, used nested for loops to create the main grid and event listeners to handle the coloring.</p>
<p>The most challenging part was having to switch from RGB to Black and vice versa. I originally approached the problem inefficiently, adding a class to hovered grids- which works fine, but it becomes more complicated when having options to change between colors, because then I was unsure where to go from there. Initially, I tried to change the CSS class itself from JavaScript, which I found wasn't an easy task. You can't just make the class from CSS either, since the random RGB value requires random number generating. So I instead modified my event listener to change the background color of the grid which worked out much better.</p>
<p>This should've been really simple, but I did have trouble dealing with the conditional cases, like handling non-number user inputs. Since I'm still fairly new to JavaScript, I forgot that prompt returns a string value and that bug went unnoticed for longer than it should've.</p>

<p>I'm hoping in the future that I won't need that prompt option, as I'm going to try and make the resizing more interactive, like a slider or a side menu bar where you can directly change the size and have the reset button independent to it.</p>

<p>3/21/2022: Okay, so I've had a problem with the grid where resizing it to a bigger size would cause centering issues and the box would grow over the max width that I set even when I centered it. Turns out the issue was that I had borders on each grid. I forgot that borders grow outwards, not inwards so that extra pixel or two accumulates as the number of grids increases. The grids were there in the first place to debug and I forgot the remove it. Whoops.. At least it's fixed now :)</p>
